	abstract = {Chimeric RNAs have been believed to be solely produced by gene fusions resulting from chromosomal rearrangement, thus unique features of cancer. Detected chimeric RNAs have also been viewed as surrogates for the presence of gene fusions. However, more and more research has demonstrated that chimeric RNAs in general are not a hallmark of cancer, but rather widely present in non-cancerous cells and tissues. At the same time, they may be produced by other mechanisms other than chromosomal rearrangement. The field of non-canonical chimeric RNAs is still in its infancy, with many challenges ahead, including the lack of a unified terminology. However, we believe that these non-canonical chimeric RNAs will have significant impacts in cancer detection and treatment.},

	abstract = {Neighboring genes transcribing in the same direction can form chimeric RNAs via cis-splicing (cis-SAGe). Previously, we reported 16 novel cis-SAGe chimeras in prostate cancer cell lines, and performed in silico validation on 14 pairs of normal and tumor samples from Chinese patients. However, whether these fusions exist in different populations, as well as their clinical implications, remains unclear. To investigate, we developed a bioinformatics pipeline using modified Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) to quantify these fusion RNAs simultaneously in silico. From RNA-Seq data of 100 paired normal and prostate cancer samples from TCGA, we find that most fusions are not specific to cancer. However, D2HGDH-GAL3ST2 is more frequently seen in cancer samples, and seems to be enriched in the African American group. Further validation with our own collection as well as from commercial sources did not detect this fusion RNA in 29 normal prostate samples, but in 19 of 93 prostate cancer samples. It is more frequently detected in late stage cancer, suggesting a role in cancer progression. Consistently, silencing this fusion resulted in dramatic reduction of cell proliferation rate and cell motility.},

	abstract = {FBN1 encodes fibrillin 1, a key structural component of the extracellular matrix, and its variants are associated with a wide range of hereditary connective tissues disorders, such as Marfan syndrome (MFS) and mitral valve–aorta–skeleton–skin (MASS) syndrome. Interpretations of the genomic data and possible genotype–phenotype correlations in FBN1 are complicated by the high rate of intronic variants of unknown significance. Here, we report two unrelated individuals with the FBN1 deep intronic variants c.6872-24T{\textgreater}A and c.7571-12T{\textgreater}A, clinically associated with MFS and MASS syndrome, respectively. The individual carrying the c.6872-24T{\textgreater}A variant is positive for aortic disease. Both individuals lacked ectopia lentis. In silico analysis and subsequent mRNA study by RT-PCR demonstrated the effect of the identified variant on the splicing process in both cases. The c.6872-24T{\textgreater}A and c.7571-12T{\textgreater}A variants generate the retention of intronic nucleotides and lead to the introduction of a premature stop codon. This study enlarges the mutation spectrum of FBN1 and points out the importance of intronic sequence analysis and the need for integrative functional studies in FBN1 diagnostics.},
